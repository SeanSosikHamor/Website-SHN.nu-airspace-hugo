  title: Sosik-Hamor Networks is MediaOps
  description: Small office, home office, and distance learning environments have
    irrevocably changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The solution is MediaOps.
  content: |-
    MediaOps is the amalgamation of modern, secure technologies, equipment, and services needed for reliable remote workforces and engaging distance learning environments. High-speed Wi-Fi networks and broadband internet connections are now the bare minimum, and the many US households with members still sharing a single mobile tablet or smartphone are falling behind.<br /><br />

    Savvy employees and students have become accustomed to the professionally- and influencer-produced HD video of YouTube channels and Instagram stories. That discerning audience now expects classroom presenters, webinar hosts, and remote team meeting leads to achieve that same degree of content quality, which requires a home-office or small-office broadcast studio.<br /><br />

    But MediaOps solutions are also for students and attendees. Slow Wi-Fi, choppy audio, low-quality webcams, and poor lighting make it difficult for teachers and presenters to interact with their viewers.

    Sosik-Hamor Networks will find your MediaOps solution, and revitalize your workspace and infrastructure.

  title: Productivity is the end product…
  content: We're firm believers in deploying the right tool for the job, and the consumer-grade
    and business-class equipment installed by many internet providers is no longer
    sufficient for the task. From laptops, tablets, and affordable enterprise-class
    Wi-Fi networks to HD webcams, studio lighting, and aesthetic backgrounds, the
    right tools ensure more productive and gratifying work and learning environments.<br
